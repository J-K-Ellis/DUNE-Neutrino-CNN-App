# DUNE-Neutrino-CNN-App
This repository includes scripts to visualize DUNE simulation data, generate plots, and prepare datasets for training and evaluating CNN models. Data is sourced from the [DUNE 2x2_sim Wiki](https://github.com/DUNE/2x2_sim/wiki/File-Data-Definitions) and used to simulate and analyze particle interactions in the DUNE detector.
